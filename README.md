#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
**Software Engineering the application of engineering principles, tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Its importance can be seen communication, entertainment, commerce and healthcare industries as it enables a more robust and easier way to get information across these major aspects of life**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
**1. programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.**

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:**
**1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.**

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**1. Waterfall: This is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation). It flows downwards like a waterfall.
2. Agile: This is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**1. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.**


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Version Control Systems (VCS): These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).**


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:**
**1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.**

**Strategies for overcoming challenges include:**
**1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.**


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.**
**2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.**

**Importance of Testing in Quality Control: 
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated _testing_, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.**


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
**Prompt Engineering is all about crafting questions and innstructions in a way that helps to get the best results/ response from the AI assisitant or robot**

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague prompt: what is an input?
improved propmt: what is an input as it relates to information technology?**

**The improved prompt will stop the robot from talking about input in a general sense, even explaining the english word but rather focus on how it relates to the response i was expecting**
